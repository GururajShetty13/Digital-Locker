# Digital Locker

## Project Overview
The **Digital Locker** is a secure and innovative locking system that eliminates the need for conventional keys. It leverages modern technologies such as Arduino Mega, Bluetooth, and GSM modules to provide password-protected access and emergency alert mechanisms.

### Key Features:
- **Password Protection:** Secure locker access through a 4x4 keypad.
- **Bluetooth Unlocking:** Connect and unlock using an Android smartphone.
- **Emergency Alerts:** Sends SMS notifications in case of unauthorized access attempts.
- **User Interface:** A 16x2 LCD screen enhances user interaction.
